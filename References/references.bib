abstract = {This article offers an overview of the applications of the wire-mesh sensor (WMS) in different environments. It presents a critical review of the literature, with relevant and recent implementations, remarkably in gas-liquid and liquid-liquid flow, comparing it with other techniques. In addition, it is shown how the sensor is adapted to each application and its different geometries, showing its flexibility. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of the WMS are analyzed. This technique can provide information about local, chordal, cross-section or in-situ volume profiles/distributions of phase fraction; velocities, size and distributions of droplets/bubbles; frequency of periodic structures; interfacial area; film thickness; flow regimes and thermal distribution.},

abstract = {Flow in piping generally has broadband random frequency characteristics. However, particular frequency components may appear. These are usually associated with fluid machinery such as compressors and pumps. Other sources of periodic excitations include valves, branch pipes, perforated plates, etc. When the particular frequency matches the acoustic natural frequency, or interacts with the acoustic characteristics of any equipment, strong flow oscillations result. The associated pressure pulsations excite the piping and/or equipment, which may result in serious damage. Oscillating flow excitation remains the subject of ongoing research. This chapter presents an outline of the research history and evaluation methods developed to date. The effects on equipment when a pressure wave occurs in piping are also discussed. Case examples and countermeasures based on the latest information are also presented.},

abstract = {This paper treats the two-phase flow-induced vibration in pipes. A broad range of two-phase flow conditions, including bubbly, dispersed and slug flow, were tested in a clamped-clamped straight horizontal pipe. The vibration response of both transversal directions for two span lengths was measured. From experimental results, an in-depth discussion on the nature of the flow excitation and flow-parameters influence is presented. The hydrodynamic mass parameter is also studied. Experimental results suggest that it is proportional to mixture density. On the other hand, two analytical formulations were developed and tested against experimental results. One formulation predicts the quadratic trend between standard deviation of acceleration and shear velocity found in experiments. The other formulation indicates that the peak-frequency of vibration response depends strongly on void fraction. It provides accurate predictions of peak-frequency, predicting 97.6{\%} of the data within ±10{\%} error bands.},

@article{Leclercq2018,
abstract = {Flexible cylinders exposed to transverse flows may undergo transverse vortex-induced vibrations due to the oscillating lift force imposed by their wake. But the drag on such structures often leads to large in-line deflections that may significantly affect the dynamics through the combined effects of the curvature-induced tension, the local inclination of the cylinder, the non-uniformity of the normal flow profile, and the large axial flow component. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of flow-induced bending on the vortex-induced dynamics of slender cantilever cylinders, by means of numerical simulations. We combine a distributed wake oscillator approach to model the dynamics of the wake with Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated body theory to account for the effect of the axial flow in the reactive (added mass) force. The use of such reduced order models facilitates the identification of the physical mechanisms at play, including through the linear analysis of the coupled fluid–structure system. We find that the primary consequence of flow-induced bending is the inhibition of single mode lock-in, replaced by a multi-frequency response of the structure, and the reduction of the vibration amplitude, as a result of the broadening of the wake excitation spectrum and of the localization of the energy transfer due to the variations induced in the normal flow profile. We also find that the curvature-induced tension is of negligible influence, but that the axial flow component may on the other hand significantly alter the dynamics owing to the destabilizing effect of the reactive force on the structural modes.},

abstract = {The simultaneous flow of gas and liquid in pipelines, over a wide range of flow rates, is characterized by a succession of aerated liquid pistons followed by elongated gas bubbles recognized as slug flow pattern. The main feature of this flow pattern is the intermittency. The gas and liquid structures do not repeat in space or time. Modeling this type of flow has been a challenge during the last four decades. Nowadays there are available steady state one dimensional models based on the unit-cell concept and more accurate physical representations based on two-fluid models or slug tracking models which embody transient flow capabilities. Despite of the modeling efforts the one-dimensional nature of these models still requires closure equations based on experimental data. They are needed to physically represent three dimensional flow features into the one-dimensional model. The objective this the article is to present a state-of-the review of closure correlations concerning: front bubble velocity, slug frequency and liquid slug holdup. An analysis on the accuracy of these correlations is performed based on direct comparison against experimental slug flow data taken by the 2PFG/DE/UNICAMP in horizontal lines.},

Potential application areas for this technique are the visualisation and measurement of two-phase and particle flows in thermofluid dynamics research, chemical processes, or transport systems for fluids and bulk solids. In our setup we used a linear deflection pattern for the electron beam and a non-annular detector arc to record transmission data of an object from different projection angles. This approach gives the highest achievable axial resolution and is comparatively moderate in effort and costs. For the inverse problem we applied iterative image reconstruction techniques to reconstruct the density distribution from a limited data set. The method has been experimentally tested on static and dynamic phantoms with a frame rate of 1000 images per second and a spatial resolution of approximately 1mm in plane and axial. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite decades of research, the study of suspension flows still continues to be a subject of great sci- entific interest. In the development of accurate models for suspension-related processes, prior knowl- edge of several flow characteristics is essential, such as spatial distribution of phases, flow regimen, relative velocity between phases, etc. Several non-invasive techniques of flow characterisation can be found in the literature, however, electrical tomography offers a vast field of possibilities due to its low cost, portability and, above all, safety of handling. In this paper, a review of the use of electrical to- mography for industrial/process monitoring purposes will be presented, giving information about the evolution throughout the years and about the limitations and advantages of the different configura- tions. Moreover, the signal de-convolution strategies, to obtain the images of the process, will also be discussed. The most recent advances in both fields will be presented. Additionally, information about the strategy adopted by the authors to produce a portable EIT system will be described. Finally, the future challenges for electrical tomography will be addressed.},

@article{Giraudeau2013,
abstract = {Momentum variation in two-phase flow generates significant low frequency forces, capa- ble of producing unwanted and destructive vibrations in nuclear or petroleum industries. Two-phase flow-induced forces in piping were previously studied over a range of diame- ters from 6mm to 70mm in different piping element geometries, such as elbows, U-bends, and tees. Dimensionless models were then developed to estimate the rms forces and generate vibration excitation force spectra. It was found that slug flow generates the largest forces due to the large momentum variation between Taylor bubbles and slugs. The present study was conducted with a 52mm diameter U-bend tube carrying a vertical upward flow. Two-phase flow-induced forces were measured. In addition, two-phase flow parameters, such as the local void fraction, bubble size and velocity, and slug frequency were studied to understand the relationship between the force spectra and the two-phase flow patterns. A new two-phase flow pattern map, based on existing transition models and validated using our own local void fraction measurements and force spectra, is proposed. This paper also presents a comparison of the present dimensionless forces with those of previous studies, thus covers a wide range of geometries and Weber numbers. Finally, a dimensionless spectrum is proposed to correlate forces with large momentum variations observed for certain flow patterns},

Measurements of vibration were performed in pipe sections of an air-water loop subjected to a wide range of flow rates of air and water.

abstract = {In this study, the non-linear vibrations of fixed-fixed tensioned pipe with vanishing flexural stiffness and conveying fluid with constant velocity are considered. The fractional calculus approach is introduced in the constitutive relationship of viscoelastic material. The pipe is on fixed support and the immovable end conditions result in the extension of the pipe during vibration and hence are introduced further nonlinear terms to the equation of motion. Analytical solutions are obtained by using the method of multiple scales. Nonlinear frequencies versus the amplitude of deflection are calculated. For frequencies close to one times the natural frequency, stability of steady-state solutions is analysed.},

abstract = {During slug flow, knowledge of the slug frequency is essential for the gas-liquid receiving facility design as well as for predicting various slug flow characteristics such as slug length and pressure drop. Various methods proposed in the literature for predicting the slugging frequency in horizontal and inclined pipes were examined. These included both empirical correlations as well as mechanistic models. Slug flow frequency data taken with an air-water system in a laboratory flow loop together with data from the published literature were compared to the predictions of the various methods. A total of 399 data points were collected covering pipe diameters from 1 to 8 in. and inclinations from 0 to 11{\&}deg; above the horizontal. A total of eight published methods were compared to the data but none was found satisfactory. For this reason, the mechanistic slug frequency model of Taitel and Dukler was investigated in detail as an alternative unbiased prediction method. This model required the solution of the unsteady-state equations for mass and momentum by a finite difference technique. This numerical model gave satisfactory results at the expense of considerable computer CPU time. For faster slug frequency calculations a new correlation was developed utilizing all 399 data points. This resulted in 0{\%} average error (bias) and 60{\%} average absolute error. This correlation represents a significant improvement in slug frequency prediction accuracy over the other methods studied.},

abstract = {Vibration signals resulting from rolling element bearing defects, present a rich content of physical information, the appropriate analysis of which can lead to the clear identification of the nature of the fault. The envelope detection or demodulation methods have been established as the dominant analysis methods for this purpose, since they can separate the useful part of the signal from its redundant Contents. This paper proposes an effective demodulation method, based on the use of a complex shifted Morlet wavelet family. The method is designed in a way that can fully exploit the underlying physical concepts of the modulation mechanism, present in the vibration response of faulty bearings, using a time-frequency representation of the signal. A key element of the proposed method is the systematic introduction of selection criteria for the automated choice of the critical parameters that characterise the Morlet wavelet family used. Experimental results and industrial measurements for two different types of bearing faults confirm the validity of the overall approach. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Electric Submersible Pumping (ESP) systems are one of the main methods of artificial lift used in oil production. The method is characterized by high production flow rate and installation flexibility. It consists of using a multistage centrifugal pump to provide energy to the oil and lift it to the production facilities. However, some operating conditions are adverse to ESP applications. Wells with high gas-oil ratios may cause deterioration of pump performance, or even lead to operational instabilities that can interrupt the oil production. The viscosity of the fluid is another factor responsible for ESP performance degradation. ESP applications in high water fractions or heavy oil fields are examples of operation with high viscosity fluids, in which the formation of emulsions can occur. The aim of this project is to improve the understanding of the factors that affect ESP performance. For this, two experimental assemblies were built. The first experimental apparatus relates to the development of a prototype pump designed to allow flow visualization within the impeller channels. The specific objective of this experimental setup is to identify the gas-liquid flow patterns that occur inside the impeller and relate them to the pump performance. The influence of viscosity and surface tension between the phases are also investigated. The second experimental assembly was developed in order to allow evaluation of a conventional ESP performance operating with viscous flow, both single phase as two phase. This experimental apparatus was used to investigate the effects of rotation, suction pressure, liquid flow rate, viscosity and installation inclination on pump operation. The experimental results of pump performance operating with single-phase viscous flow were compared to the main correction methods available in the literature and a specific correction method for the ESP model tested was proposed. Regarding the modeling of the ESP performance, an extension of an available approach is proposed in order to complete the viscous effects. The model based on the analysis of energy losses allows to evaluate head produced and power consumed by the pump},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a series of experiments conducted on a vertical 67 mm internal diameter riser to study the characteristics of slug flow generated within a multiphase air-silicone oil mixture, for a range of injected superficial gas and liquid flow rates. Air/ silicone oil flows in a riser have been investigated using advanced instrumentation called Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT), described in Hammer (1983), Huang (1995) and Zhu et al. (2003). The ECT was used to determine: the velocities of the Taylor bubbles and liquid slugs, the slug frequencies, lengths of Taylor bubbles and liquid slugs, the void fractions within the Taylor bubbles and the liquid slugs over a range of superficial liquid (0.047 ? USL ? 0.38 m/s) and gas (0.344 ? USG ? 0.745 m/ s) velocities. An examination of the experimental data concluded that the rise velocity of the observed Taylor bubbles (structure velocity) were strongly dependent on the mixture superficial velocity. The void fraction within the liquid slug and the Taylor bubbles were observed to increase with gas superficial velocity. The lengths of liquid slug and Taylor bubbles were also observed to increase with an increase in the gas superficial velocity. The liquid slug frequency was observed to increase as the liquid superficial velocity increases, but was observed to be weakly dependant on the superficial gas velocity. ? 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

An experimental study was undertaken to investigate the governing vibration excitation mechanism. Vibration response, excitation forces, and fluctuating properties of two-phase flow were measured over a wide range of flow conditions. The results show that the observed vibrations are due to a resonance phenomenon between periodic momentum flux fluctuations of two-phase flow and the first modes of the piping system. The excitation forces consist of a combination of narrow-band and periodic components, with a predominant frequency that increases proportionally to flow velocity. For a given void fraction, the force spectra for various flow velocities and elbow geometries show little scatter on a plot of a normalized power spectral density as a function of a dimensionless frequency. The predominant frequencies of excitation agree with recent results on the characteristics of periodic structures in two-phase flow},

abstract = {In this paper an improved model is developed aimed at analyzing the fluidelastic vibration of a single flexible cylinder surrounded by rigid cylinders and subject to cross-flow. Compared with other dynamical models reported previously, the nonlinearity associated with the mean axial extension of the cylinder has been accounted for in the current work. Calculations are performed to explore the effect on the nonlinear dynamics of the nonlinearity presented in the equation of motion. Numerical results show that, with increasing flow velocity just beyond a critical value, a post-Hopf limit-cycle motion occurs. For a system without loose supports, the vibration amplitude of the limit-cycle motion can be predicted by using the presented model. To understand the nonlinear dynamics of the cylinder better, a modified system with loose supports is also investigated. The impacting force induced by the loose supports was modelled by a cubic spring or by a trilinear spring. It is found, by using the theoretical model developed here, that the post-Hopf dynamics predicted with the cubic-spring representation is quite different from those predicted with the trilinear-spring representation. However, it is shown that the effect of the nonlinearity associated with the mean axial extension on the nonlinear dynamics of cylinder with loose supports is not pronounced. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.

abstract = {In this chapter, straight tubes, tube bundles, flexible plates, and shells subjected to external parallel flow are presented. Leakage-flow-induced vibrations are also discussed. In the case of straight tubes and tube bundles, most cases of concern involve random vibrations. Evaluation methods for vibration amplitude in single-phase flow as well as two-phase flow are first discussed. Flutter and divergence instabilities which are expected to occur at high flow velocities are discussed next. Structural stiffness is relatively low for flexible plates and shells. These structures are therefore more susceptible to instabilities even at low flow velocities. The feedback force-related structural vibration can be relatively large for structures subjected to leakage-flow. In this case, divergence and flutter can easily occur at relatively low flow velocity. The associated flutter and divergence analysis is presented here.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamics and stability of flexible pipes containing flowing fluid, where the flow velocity is either entirely constant, or with a small harmonic component superposed. An extensive historical review of the subject is given. In the case of constant flow velocity, the dynamics of the system is examined in a general way and it is shown that conservative systems are subject not only to buckling (divergence) at sufficiently high flow velocities, but also to oscillatory instabilities (flutter) at higher flow velocities. Also presented are some new results for cases of systems subjected to internal dissipative forces. In the case of harmonically varying flow velocity, the equation, of motion derived here exposes an error in a previous derivation. Stability, maps are presented for parametric instabilities, computed by Bolotin's method, for pipes with pined or clamped ends, as well as for cantilevered pipes. It is found that the extent of the instability regions increases with flow velocity for clamped-clamped and pinned-pinned pipes, while a more complex behaviour obtaines in the case of cantilevered pipes. In all cases, dissipation reduces the extent of, or entirely eliminates, parametric instability zones. {\textcopyright} 1974 Academic Press Inc. (London) Limited.},

abstract = {A method for measuring the spatial distribution of the void fraction in bubbly two-phase flow is presented. The method is referred to as ultrasonic void fraction profiling since it is based on the signal processing of an ultrasonic pulse scattering on a bubble interface. The method is established using two processes for the ultrasonic sensing of bubbles. One approach is to detect the bubble interface along a measurement line, i.e. the path of the ultrasonic pulse in the liquid. The interface is captured using two types of signal-processing schemes: the echo intensity method and the Doppler method. The other approach is to reconstruct the void fraction profile from the number of bubble interfaces. A theoretical formula for the estimation is proposed by considering ultrasonic reflection in a suspension of bubbles. The validity of the formula is examined with theoretical and numerical bases. Finally, the method developed here is applied to four flow configurations for the demonstration, in which the void fraction profile governs the modulation of liquid flow field.},

abstract = {The present work aims at clarifying the mechanisms of fluid-elastic vibration of tube bundles in two-phase cross flow. The experiment is conducted using air-water two-phase flow under atmospheric pressure. The test section is a 1.03-m long transparent acrylic square duct with 128 mm × 128 mm cross section, which consists of 3 rod-rows with 5 rods in each row. The rods are 125-mm long aluminum rods with 22 mm in diameter (P/D= 1.45). The natural frequency of rod vibration is about 30 Hz. The result indicated a diversion of observed trend in vibration behavior depending on two-phase flow patterns either bubbly flow or churn flow. Specifically, in churn flow, the fluid-elastic vibration has been observed to occur when the frequency in void fraction fluctuation approached to the natural frequency of the rods, but this was not the case in the fluid-elastic vibration in bubbly flow. This fact suggests the existence of mechanisms closely coupled with two-phase flow structures depending on the flow patterns, that is, static two-phase character-controlled mechanism in bubbly flow and dynamic character-controlled in churn flow. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical model to predict the unsteady fluid forces in a parallel triangular array subjected to two-phase flow. The numerical model utilizes the RANS formulation with aid of Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model, while the physics of the two-phase flow are modeled by the mixture model, drift-flux model, and the interfacial area concentration concept. This numerical model was utilized to simulate an air–water flow in tube array with various air void fractions. The predicted fluid force coefficients were compared with the available experimental data. The comparison showed a good agreement in terms of the force magnitude and phase at various reduced flow velocities. The obtained force coefficients were employed in a Hybrid analytical-CFD model representing a kernel of 7 tubes. The stability was investigated by studying the eigen values of the system as a function of the flow velocity. In addition, the stability thresholds were examined by simulating the same 7 flexible tubes kernel in cross flow using the direct flow/structure coupling. The predicted stability threshold obtained via these two models agrees very well with the experimental counterparts. They represent a lower bound for the stability data. These results are very promising and represent an important step towards an analytical frame work to accurately predict the stability of tube arrays.},

Fluid machinery often encounter serious vibration problems. For example, blades, which are critical components, may fail due to forced vibration caused by the wake from preceding blades or inlet distortion. Destabilizing forces generated by annular flow in seals may cause large-amplitude vibration of the rotary shaft. In some cases, production downtime has been caused by unstable vibration of rotors partially filled with fluid, including automatic washing machines and centrifuges. This chapter includes sections on the vibration phenomena above. The underlying mechanisms are discussed in detail followed by a presentation of evaluation methods and preventive measures.},

abstract = {This study investigated vortex-induced vibrations of a slender square-section cylinder inclined from the vertical direction by a series of angles experimentally. Both aeroelastic tests and pressure measurements were performed on the cylinder with forward inclinations (inclined to the upwind direction), a vertical attitude, and backward inclinations (inclined to the downwind direction) in a wind tunnel. The cylinder was kept stationary in the pressure measurement tests. The aeroelastic test results show that vortex-induced responses of the cylinder decrease considerably as increasing the forward inclination angle. By contrast, the effect of the backward inclination on the vortex-induced vibration varies. Not all the backward inclined cylinders exhibit crosswind responses smaller than those of the vertical cylinder does. The responses of the cylinder with a small backward inclination are significantly larger, whereas the cylinder with a large backward inclination exhibits lower responses than those of the vertical case. The variation in the vortex-induced vibration response with the inclination is explained by performing power spectral analyses on the pressure data on the side face over the cylinder span, which reveals local vortex shedding characteristics. The findings provide significant guidance to the wind-resistant design of an inclined slender structure.},

It has also been applied to direct hydrocarbon detection (Castagna et al., 2003). Broadly speaking, we also apply the principles of spectral decomposition any time we extract a wavelet or look at a spectrum. To date, most of this work has been done with the windowed (‘short-time') Fourier transform, but other ways of computing spectra are joining our collective toolbox: the S transform (Stockwell et al., 1996), wavelet transforms, and matching pursuit to name a few (e.g., Castagna and Sun, 2006).},

The flow-induced vibration signals were measured by a transducer installed on outside wall of pipe, and then the normalized energy features from different frequency bands in the vibration signals were extracted through 4-scale wavelet package transform. A "binary tree" multi-class support vector machine(MCSVM) classifier, with the normalized feature vector as inputs, and Gaussian radial basis function as kernel function, was developed to identify the three typical flow regimes including stratified wavy flow, annular mist flow, and slug flow for wet gas flow. The results show that the method can identify effectively flow regimes and its identification accuracy is about 93.3. Comparing with the other classifiers, the MCSVM classifier has higher accuracy, especially under the case of small samples.

The BWTs consist of a bluff body mounted on a flexible structure in the flow field. The shape of the bluff body and its mounting structure are different among the proposed BWTs. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the Galerkin procedure are used to derive a nonlinear distributed-parameter model for the BWTs under a fluctuating lift force due to periodically shedding vortices. The derived dynamic model is validated through comparison with a 3D CFD-FEM numerical simulation. The effects of the wind speed on the induced lift force, turbine deflection, and generated power of four BWTs are investigated. It is verified that the amplitude of the vibrations of the BWT increases significantly when the vortex shedding is synchronized with the structural oscillations. The results show that, while conic BWTs have a higher performance at post-synchronization region (i.e. high wind speeds), the right circular cylinder BWTs exhibits a better performance at pre-synchronization region (i.e. low wind speeds).},

abstract = {Wire-mesh sensors are flow imaging devices and allow the investigation of multiphase flows with high spatial and temporal resolution. This type of sensor was introduced about ten years ago at Research Center Dresden- Rossendorf, Germany and since then it has been successfully employed to investigate several single phase and two- phase flow phenomena. The sensor can be seen as a hybrid solution in between intrusive local measurement of phase fraction and tomographic cross-sectional imaging. It comprises of two set of wires stretched over the cross-section of a vessel or pipe. The planes of wires are perpendicular to each other with a small axial separation between them, thus forming a grid of electrodes. The associated electronics measures an electrical property of the flowing media at each crossing point in a very fast and multiplexed manner. The wire mesh subdivides the flow channel cross section into a number of independent sub-regions, whereas each crossing point represents one sub-region. Each of the measured signals reflects the constitution of the flow within its associated sub-region, i.e. each crossing point acts as local phase indicator. Hence, the set of data obtained from the sensor directly represents the phase distribution over the cross- section and no reconstruction procedure, e.g. by solving an inverse problem as usual in tomography, is needed in order to determine cross-sectional phase distributions. The first generation of wire-mesh sensors is based on conductivity measurements, thus being able to investigate electrically conducting fluids only. Typically air-water and steam-water flows have been investigated. Recently, the capacitance wire-mesh sensor has been developed and tested, which allow the investigation of non-conducting fluids such as oil or organic liquids. The newest systems are able to produce up to 10,000 images per second. Sensors can be constructed to operate under temperatures up to 286 °C and pressures up to 7 MPa. First this article reviews the measuring principle of wire-mesh sensors. In addition, measurement results of the application of a new-developed capacitance wire-mesh sensor to investigate two-phase gas- oil flow are presented. Furthermore, the use of a wire-mesh sensor for the investigation of a simulated three-phase flow in a laboratory setup is described and discussed. Thus, the wire-mesh sensor can considered as a simpler and inexpensive alternative to investigate either two-phase gas-liquid or three-phase gas-liquid-liquid flows. The good accuracy achieved in the permittivity measurement allows the wire-mesh system to securely distinguish even each of the three phases of a gas-oil-water flow},

abstract = {Gas-liquid pipe flow is common in nuclear, gas {\&} oil, refrigeration and power generation industries, where gas-liquid mixtures are transported in piping systems. The mixtures flows in different flow patterns, such as bubbly, slug and annular, generating dynamic fluid forces which may induce structural vibration. In many industrial cases, Flow-Induced Vibrations (FIV) are an intrinsic part of the piping operation and does not present risks that may lead to structural component failures. In this sense, the information available on this topic is quite scanty. In this paper, we present an in-depth discussion about the phenomenology of the FIV due to two-phase pipe flow. A set of 32 two-phase horizontal flow conditions was collected, including bubbly, slug and dispersed flow-patterns. The homogeneous mixture velocity J was in the range of 0.5 to 25 m/s, with homogeneous void fractions of {\&}beta; = 10{\%}, 25{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%} and 95{\%}. Signals of acceleration were acquired to correlate pipe vibration and two-phase flow parameters. Results show higher acceleration levels in slug and dispersed than in bubbly flow. We find that the acceleration frequency response contains useful information of the flow. Comparisons with single-phase flow are also presented. Finally, an exploratory experimental technique to predict two-phase flow pattern from vibration response based on the combination resonance caused by both single and two-phase flow is proposed. The results indicate that the proposed-technique is acceptable to recognize intermittent flow patterns in two-phase flow. Copyright {\&}copy; 2013 by ASME.},

abstract = {Piping systems are widely utilized for conveying fluids in many industrial fields. It is therefore vital to understand the problems that arise from vibration due to internal flows in pipes. In particular, the instability problem of a flexible pipe conveying fluid is now considered a paradigm for instability mechanisms in fluid–structure interaction systems. For this reason a significant body of research on the dynamics of flexible pipes conveying fluid exists. In this chapter, the stability behavior of flexible pipes conveying fluid is presented. The first section focuses on vibration of standard straight pipes excited by high speed and oscillating or two-phase flow. For vibration of pipes excited by internal flow the research history, the modeling methods and dynamic behavior are presented. Analysis methods for pipes excited by oscillating flow as well as two-phase fluid flow are presented next. The vibration of bellows and corrugated tubes, which are widely used in industry, is another subject addressed in this chapter. The last section of the chapter introduces the dynamics of collapsible tubes, which are important in biological engineering. For all the types of vibrations discussed in the chapter, countermeasures are also suggested.},

@article{Khushnood2004a,
abstract = {Flow-induced vibration is an important concern to the designers of heat exchangers subjected to high flows of gases or liquids. Two-phase cross-flow occurs in industrial heat exchangers, such as nuclear steam generators, condensers, and boilers, etc. Under certain flow regimes and fluid velocities, the fluid forces result in tube vibration and damage due to fretting and fatigue. Prediction of these forces requires an understanding of the flow regimes found in heat exchanger tube bundles. Excessive vibrations under normal operating conditions can lead to tube failure. Relatively little information exists on two-phase vibration. This is not surprising as single-phase flow induced vibration; a simpler topic is not yet fully understood. Vibration in two-phase is much more complex because it depends upon two-phase flow regime, i.e. characteristics of two-phase mixture and involves an important consideration, which is the void fraction. The effect of characteristics of two-phase mixture on flow-induced vibration is still largely unknown. Two-phase flow experiments are much more expensive and difficult to carry out as they usually require pressurized loops with the ability to produce two-phase mixtures. Although convenient from an experimental point of view, air-water mixture if used as a simulation fluid, is quite different from high-pressure steam-water. A reasonable compromise between experimental convenience and simulation of steam-water two-phase flow is desired. This paper reviews known models and experimental research on two-phase cross-flow induced vibration in tube bundles. Despite the considerable differences in the models, there is some agreement in the general conclusions. The effect of tube bundle geometry, random turbulence excitations, hydrodynamic mass and damping ratio on tube response has also been reviewed. Fluid-structure interaction, void fraction modeling/measurements and finally Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association (TEMA) considerations have also been highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.

Beginning in the early eighties, the personal computer (PC) market has been the dominant market influencing the semiconductor industry. Single-chip microprocessors (MPUs) enabled what became the huge PC market, which ultimately overshadowed the earlier minicomputer and mainframe computer markets. The popularity of PCs led to investments in increasingly more powerful MPUs and memory chips of ever-growing capacity. MPUs and DRAMs became the semiconductor industry technology drivers for the data processing needs of the PC. But now, DSP, as opposed to conventional data processing, has become the major technology driver for the semiconductor industry as evidenced by its market growth and the fervour of chip vendors to provide new products based on DSP technology. The increasing need to digitally process analog information signals, like audio and video, is causing a major shift in the semiconductor business. Since DSP is the mathematical manipulation of those digitized information signals, specialized math circuitry is required for efficient signal processing-circuitry that was previously confined to classical DSP chips},

The unsteady momentum flux impinging on a 'turning tee' (or a 'circular plate') has been measured at the exit of the pipe, using a force sensor. From the measured data, especially for slug flow, the predominant frequency and the RMS value of the unsteady momentum flux have been evaluated. It is found that the analytical method, given by Sim et al. for slug flow, can be used to predict the momentum flux.},

abstract = {Flow induced vibration exists commonly in multiphase flow pipelines, and the amplitude, frequency and some other characteristic parameters of pipe vibration are closely correlated with multiphase flow rate and flow regimes. The relationship between the vibration signals and gas mass fraction has been theoretically analyzed. An acceleration sensor was selected and attached to the pipe wall for the measurement of pipe vibration induced by wet gas flow, and a set of experiments has been carried out. One schematic model was put forward for explaining the interactions between two-phase flow and pipe wall. The model is much more like a closed loop control system; the input of the system is a linear combination of random vibration of two-phase flow momentum, two basic fluid-structure coupling mechanics (friction coupling and Poisson coupling) and the force arising from gas-liquid impacting on slotted orifice. The characteristic parameters of the vibration signals have been extracted and analyzed. Both experimental results and theoretical analysis show that there is a certain relationship between the standard deviation value of vibration signal and gas-liquid flow rate, and this relationship could be approximated by a function of gas mass fraction. The characteristic parameters in frequency domain, which include wavelet package energy and wavelet package energy entropy of vibration signal, are varied regularly with different flow regimes, and they are potential classification parameters for wet gas flow regimes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the late twentieth century, the notion of six degrees of separation, meaning that any two people on the planet can be connected by a short chain of people who know each other, inspired Strogatz and Watts to define the small world random graph in which each site is connected to k close neighbors, but also has long-range connections. At a similar time, it was observed in human social and sexual networks and on the Internet that the number of neighbors of an individual or computer has a power law distribution. This inspired Barabasi and Albert to define the preferential attachment model, which has these properties. These two papers have led to an explosion of research. The purpose of this book is to use a wide variety of mathematical argument to obtain insights into the properties of these graphs. A unique feature is the interest in the dynamics of process taking place on the graph in addition to their geometric properties, such as connectedness and diameter.},

The acoustical mode of the wind tunnel is simulated in the water channel by a standing free-surface wave in the transverse direction. Resonances are found to be excited due to the coupling between the resonant sound field and the unstable shear layers which separate from the tubes. This resonance phenomenon is quite distinct from, and therefore not related to, the jet instability which generates the vorticity-shedding excitation in the absence of resonance. The flow structures under resonant and non-resonant conditions are found to be entirely different. Since the jet instability dominates and the shear layer instability is suppressed at non-resonant conditions, the occurrence of resonance necessitates the switching of the flow instability from the jet mode to the shear-layer mode. The transition mechanism as well as the conditions under which this mode switching can be achieved are described in this paper. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

These equations of motion are discretized by using the Galerkin method. After the discretized equations are linearized in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium position, the natural frequencies are computed from the linearized equations. On the other hand, the time histories for the displacements are also obtained by applying the generalized-$\alpha$ time integration method to the non-linear discretized equations.

abstract = {In this study, the non-linear transverse vibrations of highly tensioned pipes with vanishing flexural stiffness and conveying fluid with variable velocity are investigated. The pipe is on fixed supports and the immovable end conditions result in the extension of the pipe during vibration and hence introduce further non-linear terms to the equation of motion. The velocity is assumed to be a harmonic function about a mean velocity. These systems experience a Coriolis acceleration component which renders such systems gyroscopic. The equation of motion is solved analytically by direct application of the method of multiple scales (a perturbation technique). Principal parametric resonance cases are investigated in detail. Non-linear frequencies are derived depending on amplitude. For frequencies close to two times the natural frequency, stability and bifurcations of steady-state solutions are analyzed. For frequencies close to zero, it is shown that the amplitudes are bounded in time. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The nuclear engineering test reactor in this paper is a small nuclear reactor designed and manufactured in China. The structure of this nuclear reactor is different from the normal pressurized water reactors. Especially, these are some tubes in the nuclear reactor, which are named radiation tube, neutron tube and temperature tube. The vibration induced in the flexible tubes by vortex shedding is practical importance, which is related to the safety of this nuclear reactor. However, it is difficult to obtain the natural frequencies and the dynamic characteristics of the tubes with the undetermined boundary conditions only by numerical analysis. In this paper, a 1/2 scaled-down model of this nuclear reactor was manufactured, and the modal experiment was made to obtain the natural frequencies both in air and in water. Based on the results of the modal test in air and water, the restraint stiffness of the tubes was calculated. Then, CFD analysis was made to calculate the velocities and the vortex shedding frequencies of the flow near the tubes and the vibration equations of the tubes were presented to calculate the dynamic responses of the tubes. A dynamic test was also made to verify the accuracy of the calculation. Compared the results of numerical calculation to the results of dynamic test, it is obvious that the numerical analysis method can reflect the dynamic characteristics of the scaled-down model with a valid margin of error.},

abstract = {By taking a pipe as Timoshenko beam, in this paper the original 4-equation model of pipe conveying fluid was modified by taking the dynamic effects of fluid into account. The shape function that always used in the finite element method was replaced by the exact wave solution of the modified four equations. And then the dynamic stiffness was deduced for the free vibration of pipe conveying fluid. The proposed method was validated by comparing the results of critical velocity with analytical solution for a simply supported pipe at both ends. In the example, the proposed method was applied to calculate the first three natural frequencies of a three span pipe with twelve meters long in three different cases. The results of natural frequency for the pipe conveying stationary fluid fitted well with that calculated by finite element software Abaqus. It was shown that the dynamic stiffness method can still hold high precision even though the element's size was quite large. And this is the predominant advantage of the proposed method comparing with conventional finite element method. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In steam generators and other heat exchangers, there are a lot of tube bundles subjected to two-phase cross-flow. The fluctuating pressure on tube bundle structure caused by turbulence can induce structural vibration. The power spectral density (PSD) of buffeting force is usually required as the input of random vibration analysis. Since there is no generally accepted method to compute the normalized buffeting forces, the acknowledged upper bound of buffeting forces due to two-phase flow is absent. This paper presents a new set of upper bound of buffeting forces in two-phase flow by modifying the mixture velocity proposed by de Langre. The new upper bound is compared with the one based on single-phase flow, and de Langre's upper bound when two-phase flow is considered. Through a sample of steam generator tube subjected to non-uniform two-phase cross-flow, the random vibration responses based upon three types of upper bounds are computed. The proposed upper bound lies between the one derived from single-phase flow modeling and the one proposed by de Langre. It turns out that the newly proposed upper bound could cover sufficient experimental data sets of the buffeting force and is below the de Langre's bound over a wide frequency range.},

@article{Beguin2009,
abstract = {Two-phase flow is common in the nuclear industry. It is a potential source of vibration in piping systems. In this paper, two-phase damping in the bubbly flow regime is related to the interface surface area and, therefore, to flow configuration. Experiments were performed with a vertical tube clamped at both ends. First, gas bubbles of controlled geometry were simulated with glass spheres let to settle in stagnant water. Second, air was injected in stagnant alcohol to generate a uniform and measurable bubble flow. In both cases, the two-phase damping ratio is correlated to the number of bubbles (or spheres). Two-phase damping is directly related to the interface surface area, based on a spherical bubble model. Further experiments were carried out on tubes with internal two-phase air-water flows. A strong dependence of two-phase damping on flow parameters in the bubbly flow regime is observed. A series of photographs attests to the fact that two-phase damping in bubbly flow increases for a larger number of bubbles, and for smaller bubbles. It is highest immediately prior to the transition from bubbly flow to slug or churn flow regimes. Beyond the transition, damping decreases. It is also shown that two-phase damping increases with the tube diameter. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the oil industry, the well stream often consists of a full range of hydrocarbons and a variety of non-wanted components such as water, carbon dioxide, salts, sulfur, and sand. The need for multiphase flow metering (MFM) arises when it is necessary or desirable to meter the flow upstream of the separators. The ultrasonic technique fulfils many of the requirements for MFM in the oil industry (mainly, non-invasive, non-radiative, robust, and relatively non-expensive) and has the capability to provide the information required. The drawback of current ultrasonic techniques, as is the case with other MFM methods, is the need for prior signal calibration. A broader solution to this issue could be the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs provide a non-linear mapping between input and output variables and the cross-correlation among these variables and could be an alternative tool for automatic identification of flow patterns. In this context, the objectives of the current investigation are two-fold: (i) to present and analyze acoustic attenuation data for vertical, upward oil-continuous multiphase flows in 1-in. and 2-in. acrylic pipes and flow patterns ranging from bubbly flows to annular flows; (ii) to develop neural networks for flow pattern recognition and gas volume fraction (GVF) measurement using the ultrasonic attenuation data as input. The results shown testify to the ability of the neural networks and the ultrasonic technique to perform these tasks.},

abstract = {In order to optimize a steam generator tube bundle support system, it is necessary to understand the differences in vibration behavior of tube arrays subjected to a two-phase flow regime as compared to a single phase flow regime. The relationships discussed in this paper are based on findings derived from a comprehensive vibration testing program which included both water and simulated two-phase (air-water) flow regimes. Tube bundles of various configurations and spacings were tested in crossflow using 3/4 in. (1.9 cm) and 7/8 in. (2.2 cm) o.d. tubes with 36 in. (91 cm) span lengths and as many as 40 tubes per array. Sufficient test loop capacity was provided to drive most test array configurations up to and beyond fluid-elastic instability. Parameters obtained included displacement, effective force coefficients, damping coefficients, Strouhal numbers, and instability constants for various tube array configurations in both liquid and simulated two-phase flow mediums.},

abstract = {Two-phase internal flow is present in many piping system components. Although two-phase damping is known to be a significant constituent of the total damping, the energy dissipation mechanisms that govern two-phase damping are not well understood. In this paper, damping of three different clamped-clamped tubes subjected to two-phase air-water internal axial flow is investigated. Experimental data are reported, showing a strong dependence of two-phase damping on void fraction, flow velocity and flow regime. Data-points plotted on two-phase flow pattern maps indicate that damping is greater in a bubbly flow regime. The two-phase damping ratio reaches a maximum value at the highest void fraction before the transition to a churn flow regime. An analytical model that relates the two-phase damping ratio to the interface surface area is proposed. The model is based on rigid spherical bubbles in cubic elementary flow volumes. The analytical results are well correlated with the experiments. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The flow over three cylinders arranged in-line with uneven spacing in cross-flow is numerically investigated at a Reynolds number of 200. The center-to-center distance between the upstream and the most downstream cylinder was kept constant at 4 diameters. The distance between the inline centers of the upstream and middle cylinders (x) was studied in the range of 1.05 to 2.95 diameters. The flow structure around the cylinders shows two distinctive patterns of vortex shedding, one of which occurs at x=1.60 and 1.80 diameters, and causes significantly higher oscillating lift and mean drag forces with a lower value of Strouhal number. At these middle cylinder locations, the shear layer reattaches on the downstream cylinder and results in vortex formation in the gap between the middle and downstream cylinders. On the other hand, at all other locations of the middle cylinder the shear layer does not reattach on the downstream cylinder. Moreover, when the middle cylinder is located at x=1.60 or 1.80 diameters, the vortex formation length is shorter and the vorticity in the downstream vortex street is higher than the case when the middle cylinder is located at all other locations. To understand the effect of these distinctive flow features on the flow-induced vibration response of the most downstream cylinder, the coupling between the flow field and the cylinder motion is numerically modeled. As the reduced velocity is increased, the oscillation amplitude of the downstream cylinder increases to its maximum at lock-in, then it starts to decrease similar to the case of a single cylinder. However, the oscillation amplitude reaches a higher value than that observed for the case of vortex-induced vibration of both a single cylinder and two tandem cylinders. Moreover, significant oscillation amplitude is pertained at high reduced velocities with dependency on the uneven spacing between the cylinders. The frequency of oscillations increases at different rates in three different ranges of reduced velocities, indicating different energy transfer mechanisms. Although the frequency of vibration is shifted away from the structure resonance frequency at high reduced velocities, the significant amplitude of oscillations is attributed to the interaction of two opposing mechanisms that occur when the cylinder is at different positions in the cycle. The wide range of reduced velocities at which the cylinder vibrates with a significant amplitude makes the configuration of three in-line cylinders a good candidate for flow energy harvesting.},

The governing equations are solved using an Element-based Finite Volume Method in a moving mesh. The model implementation is only possible due to the meticulous mesh generation and motion algorithm described herein, which is considered to be one of the main contributions of the present work. The model developed in this study is capable of precisely predicting volumetric efficiency and viscous loses in addition to providing detailed information about the pressure and velocity fields inside the device. Turbulence effects are accurately treated with advanced turbulence models. In addition, although the presented results are for single phase flow, the model can be extended to account for multiphase flows using models available in CFD software. In addition, some aspects related to inertial effects that are not captured by simplified models are analyzed using this model. The results presented herein consider a rigid stator pump. The model was validated against experimental results from literature. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B. V.},

@article{Hibiki1998,
abstract = {A preliminary study was conducted experimentally in order to investigate the effect of flow-induced vibration on flow structure in two-phase flow. Two kinds of experiments were performed, namely ‘reference' (no vibration) and ‘vibration' experiments. In the reference experiment, an experimental loop was fixed tightly by three structural supports, whereas the supports were loosen a little in the vibration experiment. In the vibration experiment vibration was induced by flowing two-phase mixture in the loop. For relatively low superficial liquid velocity, flow-induced vibration promoted the bubble coalescence but liquid turbulence energy enhanced by the vibration might not be enough to break up the bubble. This leaded to the marked increase of Sauter mean diameter, and the marked decrease of interfacial area concentration. Accordingly, flow-induced vibration changed the void fraction profile from ‘wall peak' to ‘core peak' or ‘transition', which increased distribution parameter in the drift-flux model. For high superficial liquid velocity, shear-induced liquid turbulence generated by two-phase flow itself might be dominant for liquid turbulence enhanced by flow-induced vibration. Therefore, the effect of flow-induced vibration on local flow parameters was not marked as compared with that for low superficial liquid velocity. Since it is anticipated that flow structure change due to flow-induced vibration would affect the interfacial area concentration, namely interfacial transfer term, further study may be needed under the condition of controlled flow-induced vibration.},

The use of the GITT approach in the analysis of the transverse vibration equation lead to a coupled system of second order differential equations in the dimensionless temporal variable. The Mathematica's built-in function, NDSolve, was employed to numerically solve the resulting transformed ODE system. The characteristics of gas-liquid two-phase flow were represented by a slip-ratio factor model that was devised and used for similar problems. Good convergence behavior of the proposed eigenfunction expansions is demonstrated for calculating the transverse displacement at various points of pipes conveying air-water two-phase flow. Parametric studies were performed to analyze the effects of the volumetric gas fraction and the volumetric flow rate on the dynamic behavior of pipes conveying air-water two-phase flow. Besides, the normalized volumetric-flow-rate stability envelope for the dynamic system was obtained.},

abstract = {The aeroacoustic response of two side-by-side circular cylinders in cross-flow is investigated experimentally. In order to investigate the effect of the gap between the cylinders on the acoustic resonance mechanism, six spacing ratios between the cylinders, in the range of T/D=1.25-3, have been investigated, where D is the diameter of the cylinders and T the centre-to-centre distance between them. Special attention is given to the intermediate spacing ratio range, which exhibits bistable flow regimes in the absence of resonance. During the tests, the acoustic cross-modes of the duct housing the cylinders are self-excited. For the intermediate spacing ratios, T/D=1.25, 1.35, 1.46 and 1.75, two distinct vortex-shedding frequencies at the off-resonance conditions are observed. These are associated with the wide and narrow wakes of the cylinders, as described in the literature. In this case, acoustic resonances occur at a Strouhal number, which is between those observed before the onset of resonance. The acoustic resonance synchronizes vortex shedding in the two wakes and thereby eliminates the bistable flow phenomenon. For large spacing ratios, T/D=2.5 and 3, vortex shedding occurs at a single Strouhal number at which the acoustic resonance is excited. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
